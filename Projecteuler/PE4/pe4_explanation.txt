We compute the product p = i * k, where i and k are 3 digit numbers
and check if p is a palindrome.

To check if p is a palindrome we convert p to a string s
and compare s to reverse(s).

In Python this can be done with 
s = str(p)
s == s[::-1], 

and in C++11 this can be done with 
string s = to_string(p)
s == string(s.rbegin(), s.rend()).

Solution to https://projecteuler.net/problem=3

Idea: 
Let n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pm^km be the prime factorization of n.
Then the largest prime factor can be determined as follows.

- Case 1: All prime factors are at most sqrt(n). Then the largest prime factor 
is among the numbers from 2 to sqrt(n).

- Case 2: At least one prime factor is greater than sqrt(n).
Then there can only be exactly one prime factor greater than sqrt(n). 
Otherwise, if we had two prime factors greater
than sqrt(n), let's call them a and b, their product a*b would be greater than n
which is a contradiction. So n takes the form
n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ...p_{m-1}^k_{m-1} * pm
with p1, ..., p_{m-1} at most sqrt(n) and pm greater than sqrt(n). pm is the largest
prime factor.

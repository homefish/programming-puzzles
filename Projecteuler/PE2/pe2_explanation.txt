We calculate the terms of the Fibonacci sequence iteratively with a loop.

Steps:
We initialize a variable total = 2 since at the beginning we start with the terms 1 and 2, 
and 2 is an even number.

The Fibonacci sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc..
Let's write variables a, b and c below the sequence to indicate the calculation:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ..
a  b  c

We calculate the sum c = a + b, which is the next Fibonacci term after a and b, and move the variables one step to the right:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ..
   a  b  c
   
We repeat this step until c exceeds the upper bound of four million.
At each step we check whether c is even. If c is even we add it to our total,
otherwise omit it.

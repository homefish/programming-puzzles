We calculate the terms of the Fibonacci sequence iteratively with a loop.
The Fibonacci sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc..

Steps:
1) We initialize a variable total = 2 since at the beginning we start with the terms 1 and 2, 
and 2 is an even number. 

Let's write variables a, b and c below the sequence to indicate the calculation:
We calculate the sum c = a + b, which is the next Fibonacci term after a and b, 

1, 2, 3,
a  b  c

2) We move the variables one step to the right:

1, 2, 3, 5,
   a  b  c
   
We repeat step 1) by calculating c = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5 
until c exceeds the upper bound of four million.
At each step we check whether c is even. If c is even we add it to our total,
otherwise we omit it.


Let's perform another step to illustrate the process:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8
      a  b  c
      
This time c = a + b = 3 + 5 = 8 is even, so we add 8 to our 'total' variable.
